# Oven to Air Fryer Converter

A small react project to convert oven cooking instructions into instructions suitable to use with an air fryer.
I've added unit tests and a screenshot test so that it's easier to update and maintain this little project in the future.

## Features

- Change units (Fahrenheit and Celsius)
- Change oven type (convection/fan assisted oven and conventional oven)
- Responsive

## Commands

Run locally: `npm run dev`
Unit tests: `npm run test:unit`
Screenshot test(s): `npm run test:screenshot`
Linting: `npm run lint`
